### Repo of Python Apps

#### This repo contains a collections of apps written in python.
- The code is mostly from a Udemy corse that i followed along with.
- I have made edits to fix broken parts in the code
- The code is absolutely not 'pythonic'
    1. Name conventions break all of the rules
    2. Class instantiation is irregular
    3. Boolean reference is against PEP8 recommendations
    4. Some code in the course only worked on a Windows based system. I was able to code around most issues to make it linux compatible.
